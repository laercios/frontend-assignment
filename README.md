# Intricately Front-End Challenge

Requirements and design mocks are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B3ofnK0Nc2Dawtpj1fLky9ekzqjjri_EjDXQv8Nmpiw/edit#heading=h.rmoqo627p0vn).

## Prerequisite
  * Docker and docker-compose installed.

All commands described in this document should be executed from the project's root directory.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, run command: docker-compose up. When it's done building, the app is accessible from `localhost:8080`.

You can run project without docker, just enter inside ./app folder and run
commands `npm install`, and run `npm start`.
